    Application Number : 202041003260, Patent Number: 345169
    
     <p align="justify">
     The present invention discloses an artificial intelligence powered automated system (8) which broadcasts content based on relevance to a real time targeted audience using scene-understanding, image-descriptive techniques, object detection, and classification techniques. It includes an image grabbing framework (1) which captures live feed and pushes captured data into a control box (3). The control box (3) processes the data received from servers (4) and image grabbing framework (1), selects the most relevant content and sends to display device (2). The blockchain module (5) records information of the displayed content. The visual representation module (6) is used to provide a visually understandable form of data stored in blockchain module (5). The client dashboard (7) displays data as created by visual representation module (6) using data obtained from the blockchain module (5).Ref: Figure 1(a)
